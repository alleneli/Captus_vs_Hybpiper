## Comparing two bioinformatics pipelines: Captus and HybPiper

A comparison between the pipeline Captus and the pipeline it is supposed to replace, HybPiper. 

Both pipelines align raw nucleotide sequence reads for the use of phylogenetic analyses. 

I will use raw sequence reads from the tropical angiosperm genus *Costus* as a test dataset to compare their alignment processes and resulting phylogentic trees. Only a subset of the full data set will be used, specifically testinmg the placement of the new species *C. flammulus*.

As our ability to process high throughput data and the field of systematics grows, it is important to keep improving and testing the newest tools and pipelines available.
